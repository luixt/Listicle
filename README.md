# Listicle# WEB103 Project 1 & 2 - Discover EDM

Submitted by: **Luis Delgado**

It uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client (development with Vite) and a minimal Express server that serves the built site and an events API on port 3001.

## Notes

<!-- NOTES FOR PART 1
It was extremely challenging to start building this project, working with only vanilla javascript, barely any HTML directly implemented. The lab previous to this assignment was absolutely helpful to figure out issues an debugging, which made most of the time in this project. Also, the CSS implementation was slightly confusing.
